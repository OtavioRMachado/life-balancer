# Life Balancer

The Life balancer is an idea I had when it turned hard for me to balance my professional and personal goals with having an enjoyable life. This idea is supposed to solve the following difficulties:
- Knowing when I'm working or being productive more than I should and having no life;
- Realising when I'm only spending my time on youtube watching cat videos and should be more productive;
- Turning this complicated task into a game where you can actually share with the world and your friends what you've been up to;
- Taking the "What are you doing now?" to the next level;
- Earning cool badges and achievements for the stuff you already had to do anyways;
- Finding people that are doing the same things you are;

### Resuming the idea
So the main idea is having a place where you earn points/coins for doing things you see as productive por a period of time and spending these points or coins in the things that are not necessarily productive, but that you love doing - so you can do them without worrying that you're having too much fun when you should be developing yourself and being even more productive.

### How is it going to be developed?
Sincerely, I don't have the slightest idea. I want to learn new stuff so I can also be productive and learn as much as I can while developing it.
I'll write down the tech stack and everything else as soon as I decide that.
